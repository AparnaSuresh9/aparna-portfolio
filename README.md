# 📚 Applied Data Science Portfolio – Aparna Bharathi Suresh

## 👩‍💼 About Me

I'm an Analytics Engineer and Generative AI Practitioner with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and distributed data systems. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Analytics at San Jose State University, I specialize in building intelligent, end-to-end data-driven solutions across domains like healthcare, NLP, and enterprise analytics.

With over 3 years of experience in industry, I’ve developed systems ranging from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and LLM-based applications to ETL workflows, interactive dashboards, and cloud-native deployments. I enjoy transforming complex datasets into actionable insights through MLOps, prompt engineering, and scalable infrastructure.

💡 Interests: Generative AI, Big Data, Machine Learning, Visualization
